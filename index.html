            <h2>Use of Airtel Xstream:</h2>
            <p id="line">
                Airtel Xstream is an android tv(televion) which costs less. You can control the mobile features like
                Youtube, Prime video, Disney + hotstar and many other things with the help of your remote. You can also 
                change the channel of your tv with the same remote. If you had an airtel or Airtel HD settopbox, you can upgrade it so that you can
                use your old remote too. I reccomend you to buy Airtel Xstream to enjoy if you hate living in your home without going out.
            </p>
            <p id="line">
                If you have a mobile or tab(tablet) with you, you can download the airtel Xstream app to control your tv with your mobile, 
                and you can also play games with your mobile. If you download the app, you have an option to play the game, which will open
                a gamepad in your phone.

            <h2>Casting:</h2>
            <p id="line">
                There are some advantages and disadvantages in casting of Airtel Xstream.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The advantage 1 is the casting ability. Airtel Xstream can screen cast whereas Airtel and Airtel HD cannot
                        screen cast.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The second advantage is the sound. When you screen cast, some android tv(s) like Haier Android Tv does
                        not share the sound. But Airtel Xstream can share the sound too.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The disadvantage 1 is the struck. Sometimes, the screen casting becomes slow and strucks(freezes (or) Hangs).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The second disadvantage is that the screen share option will not appear on some devices like Redmi. This means
                        that Airtel Xstream cannot cast the screen of some devices like Redmi
                    </p>
